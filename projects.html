        Web Platform Performance Optimization
      </h3>
      <p>
        The application originally took up to <strong>8 seconds</strong> to fully load each page, which resulted in frequent user complaints and poor perceived performance.
        After internal discussions, I was responsible for investigating the root causes and implementing technical improvements.
      </p>

      <p>
        The platform stack at the time was:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Framework:</strong> WordPress (PHP)</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MariaDB</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud provider:</strong> SaveInCloud</li>
        <li><strong>CDN:</strong> Bunny.net</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After analyzing application behavior and infrastructure bottlenecks, I identified the main performance issues and implemented the following improvements:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Private page caching:</strong> Enabled fast load times for returning users, delivering an immediate performance gain.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lazy loading:</strong> Shifted part of the rendering workload to the frontend, reducing server-side processing and improving perceived load time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Public page caching:</strong> After introducing lazy loading, pages could be safely cached publicly while private data was fetched asynchronously on the client side.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>On-demand plugin loading:</strong> Modified WordPress initialization to load only required plugins per request, significantly improving API response times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloud functions:</strong> Introduced serverless functions to deliver critical page data, improving resilience during peak traffic and server overload.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a result, full page load time was reduced to approximately <strong>2 seconds</strong> (a <strong>4× improvement</strong>), while also significantly lowering overall server load and increasing platform stability.
      </p>

      <h3 id="fisarmonica__visual-enhancement">Web Platform UX and Visual Enhancement</h3>
      <p>
        This project focused on the visual enhancement and user experience improvement of an existing web platform.
        I was responsible for implementing the interfaces designed by the web designer and proposing improvements
        to increase usability, consistency, and overall user satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our main goal was to significantly improve the user experience by refining visual elements,
        navigation flow, and interaction patterns across the platform.
      </p>

      <p>
        To better understand how users interacted with the application, we leveraged analytics and behavior
        tools such as <strong>Microsoft Clarity</strong> and <strong>Hotjar</strong>. These insights allowed us
        to identify usability friction points, analyze user journeys, and propose data-driven UX enhancements.
      </p>

      <p>
        Key contributions included:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementation of responsive and accessible UI components based on the designer’s specifications,
          ensuring visual consistency across desktop and mobile devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          UX improvements driven by user behavior analysis, including layout refinements, clearer information
          hierarchy, and optimized navigation flows.
        </li>
        <li>
          Active collaboration with design, product, and business teams to propose and validate interface
          enhancements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Introduction of gamification features such as <strong>points accumulation</strong>,
          <strong>achievement badges</strong>, and <strong>leaderboards</strong> to increase user engagement
          and retention.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a result of these visual and UX improvements, the platform became more intuitive and engaging.
        Combined with the efforts of the sales team, these changes helped <strong>almost double the user base</strong>,
        directly supporting business growth and customer acquisition.
