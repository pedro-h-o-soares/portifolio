      Large-Scale Data Analytics Dashboard
    </h3>
    <p>
      This project involved the design and implementation of a large-scale analytics dashboard for the
      <strong>technical production unit</strong>, built on top of a Databricks environment containing
      more than <strong>one billion rows</strong> of coil production measurements collected over the last
      three years.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of the dashboard was to enable technical and production teams to run simulations over
      historical data in order to evaluate whether new customer orders could be fulfilled
      <strong>without risking material loss</strong> or compromising production constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Simulation performance was a critical requirement, as users needed to evaluate
      <strong>multiple scenarios in a short period of time</strong>. Long execution times would make
      iterative analysis impractical and directly impact decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      To achieve the required performance and scalability, I led the following technical initiatives:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Query optimization:</strong> Conducted an in-depth analysis of complex queries involving
        multiple filters and joins, restructuring them to minimize execution time on large datasets.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>View materialization:</strong> Identified performance bottlenecks and created
        materialized views to precompute expensive operations, significantly reducing query latency.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dashboard implementation:</strong> Designed and implemented the final solution using
        <strong>Databricks Dashboards</strong>, enabling interactive simulations over the full dataset.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a result, the dashboard was able to execute simulations over the entire dataset in
      <strong>under 3 minutes</strong>, making it viable for real-time, scenario-based decision-making
      in a high-stakes industrial environment.

      Web Platform Performance Optimization
    </h3>
    <p>
      The application originally took up to <strong>8 seconds</strong> to fully load each page, which resulted in
      frequent user complaints and poor perceived performance.
      After internal discussions, I was responsible for investigating the root causes and implementing technical
      improvements.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform stack at the time was:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Framework:</strong> WordPress (PHP)</li>
      <li><strong>Database:</strong> MariaDB</li>
      <li><strong>Cloud provider:</strong> SaveInCloud</li>
      <li><strong>CDN:</strong> Bunny.net</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      After analyzing application behavior and infrastructure bottlenecks, I identified the main performance issues and
      implemented the following improvements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Private page caching:</strong> Enabled fast load times for returning users, delivering an immediate
        performance gain.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lazy loading:</strong> Shifted part of the rendering workload to the frontend, reducing server-side
        processing and improving perceived load time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Public page caching:</strong> After introducing lazy loading, pages could be safely cached publicly
        while private data was fetched asynchronously on the client side.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>On-demand plugin loading:</strong> Modified WordPress initialization to load only required plugins per
        request, significantly improving API response times.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud functions:</strong> Introduced serverless functions to deliver critical page data, improving
        resilience during peak traffic and server overload.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a result, full page load time was reduced to approximately <strong>2 seconds</strong> (a <strong>4×
      improvement</strong>), while also significantly lowering overall server load and increasing platform stability.
    </p>

    <h3 id="fisarmonica__cloud-migration">Google Cloud Platform Migration</h3>
    <p>
      This project focused on the migration of the Fisarmonica learning platform from
      <strong>SaveInCloud</strong> to <strong>Google Cloud Platform</strong>, with the goal of improving
      scalability, reliability, and operational flexibility as the platform continued to grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      The existing infrastructure presented limitations in scalability, resilience, and deployment
      flexibility, especially during traffic peaks and platform updates. To address these challenges,
      I designed and led the migration to a cloud-native architecture on Google Cloud.
    </p>

    <p>
      The new infrastructure was built using the following core components:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):</strong> Containerized the application and deployed it
        on a managed Kubernetes cluster, enabling horizontal scaling, rolling updates, and improved
        operational stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud SQL:</strong> Migrated the relational database to a managed service, improving
        reliability, backup management, and operational maintenance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NFS:</strong> Implemented shared storage to support persistent data and media files
        across multiple application instances.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud Functions:</strong> Implemented serverless functions to handle
        <strong>critical system endpoints</strong>, increasing resilience, isolating failure domains,
        and ensuring availability during high-load scenarios.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a result of this migration, the platform achieved improved availability, easier scalability,
      and a more robust deployment process. The cloud-native architecture provided a strong foundation
      for future growth, performance optimization, and continued feature development.
    </p>

    <h3 id="fisarmonica__visual-enhancement">Web Platform UX and Visual Enhancement</h3>
    <p>
      This project focused on the visual enhancement and user experience improvement of an existing web platform.
      I was responsible for implementing the interfaces designed by the web designer and proposing improvements
      to increase usability, consistency, and overall user satisfaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our main goal was to significantly improve the user experience by refining visual elements,
      navigation flow, and interaction patterns across the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      To better understand how users interacted with the application, we leveraged analytics and behavior
      tools such as <strong>Microsoft Clarity</strong> and <strong>Hotjar</strong>. These insights allowed us
      to identify usability friction points, analyze user journeys, and propose data-driven UX enhancements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Key contributions included:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Implementation of responsive and accessible UI components based on the designer’s specifications,
        ensuring visual consistency across desktop and mobile devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        UX improvements driven by user behavior analysis, including layout refinements, clearer information
        hierarchy, and optimized navigation flows.
      </li>
      <li>
        Active collaboration with design, product, and business teams to propose and validate interface
        enhancements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduction of gamification features such as <strong>points accumulation</strong>,
        <strong>achievement badges</strong>, and <strong>leaderboards</strong> to increase user engagement
        and retention.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      As a result of these visual and UX improvements, the platform became more intuitive and engaging.
      Combined with the efforts of the sales team, these changes helped <strong>almost double the user base</strong>,
      directly supporting business growth and customer acquisition.
